# Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

1.  **Extend GitHub with ZenHub**. Until Github releases its forthcoming **Timeline** product, Zenhub extends Github functionality for free to create **Roadmaps** that provide a Gantt chart of a **Project** progress by **Epic**, which contain multiple Github **Issues**. Projects and Epics have start and end dates associated with them in the context of a larger **Workspace**, which is associated with a set of Github **Repos**.\
2.  **Cluster Issues into Epics**. By clustering Github Issues into Epics you can also communicate higher level project tasks and progress to non-technical stakeholders.\
3.  **Create Roadmap of Epics in Projects**. The Roadmap can only work interactively with team members logged into Zenhub (with their Github logins), but you can export the Roadmap as an image.\
4.  **Export Roadmap as image to display on web page**. This provides a public view of your project and progress.

# Create Zenhub Workspace [lead only]

Choose a member of your team with admin privileges to your Github organization. Visit [zenhub.com](https://www.zenhub.com), click on **Login** and **Log in using GitHub**.

Start off by creating a workspace, granting Zenhub access to Github repositories and inviting your team to the Zenhub workspace:

1.  [Grant ZenHub third-party access permissions in GitHub](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000010369-granting-third-party-access-in-github-for-zenhub#:~:text=Checking%20access%20permissions). Be sure to follow all instructions under **Checking access permissions** and for your Github profile (e.g. `@bbest`), i.e. `https://github.com/settings/applications`, to ensure your group project's Github organization has granted ZenHub permissions.\

2.  [Create your First Workspace](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000497224-creating-your-first-team-workspace). Create a workspace named after your Github org `{org} workspace`.\
    \
    ![](img/lab4_roadmap/zenhub_create-workspace.png){width="800"}\
    Note that the **Import Github Projects** option is only for the old Github Projects, not the new Github Projects Beta, so only **Add repos** when Creating a new ZenHub workspace. Be sure to first select your organization in the lower right.\
    ![](img/lab4_roadmap/zenhub_add-repos-to-workspace.png){width="500"}\
    Upon creation of a workspace you are taken to the default Board view with all open issues in the connected repositories showing up under the **New Issues** pipeline.\
    ![](img/lab4_roadmap/zenhub_fresh-board.png){width="800"}\
    Note descriptions for the other pipelines like **Icebox** (low priority issues), **Product Backlog** (upcoming issues), **Sprint Backlog** (ready issues for sprint), **In Progress**, **Review/QA**, **Done**.

3.  [Invite your Team to ZenHub](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000035792-inviting-your-team-to-zenhub).\
    Be sure to invite me by sending link to `ben@ecoquants.com`. Otherwise I will not be able to view (and grade) your workspace.

# Create Roadmap

Click over to the Roadmap menu.

1.  **Create a new project**. You can give it the same name as your `{org}`. Set the dates to start from when your Lab 1 Gantt chart started, e.g. Nov 1 to Dec 5, 2021.\
    ![](img/lab4_roadmap/zenhub_roadmap.png){width="800"}

2.  **Add epics** by clicking the plus sign `+` next to the project. Create epics that describe the major phases of the project and set start/end dates. To associate Closed issues with an Epic, you might wna\

3.  **Add issues to the epics** by going to the **Board**, selecting issues by clicking on the upper left avatar of the issue to select it and then the **Set epic** button.\
    ![](img/lab4_roadmap/zenhub_select-issues-set-epic.png)\
    \
    clicking the linked name of the epic, and in the Epic view click the link to **Add issues to this Epic**.

Note that as issues close, the progress meter increments for the associated Epic and Project.

# Add Roadmap to Website

You can share a link to the roadmap, but only members of your team can view it. You can, however, export it as an image.

1.  **Export image** of Roadmap with the Share button and save as `images/roadmap.svg` in your `{org}.github.io` repo. You might want to prepend the date by a week to get it to show properly on export. \
    ![](img/lab4_roadmap/zenhub_share-roadmap.png)

2.  **Add Roadmap page to website**. Create a roadmap web page with this image. Add a menu item for Roadmap to your website. Hints:

    -   Use the markdown syntax for including an image `![](images/roadmap.svg)` in a new Rmarkdown `roadmap.Rmd`.

    -   Menu items are determined by your `_site.yml`. See: [10.5 rmarkdown's site generator \| R Markdown](%5Bhttps://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html)](<https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html>)).

    -   You can rebuild the whole website by either: 1) clicking the Build Website button in the Build pane of RStudio; or 2) running `rmarkdown::render_site()` in the Console pane.

    -   Be sure to git push the website and ensure the new page is publicly accessible.
